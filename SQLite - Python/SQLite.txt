SQLite is a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine. SQLite is the most widely deployed
database in the world. SQLite is built into all mobile phones and most computers and comes bundled inside countless other applications 
that people use every day.

SQLite is a relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses a client-server architecture. The client is the application that 
uses the database, and the server is the database itself. SQLite is a single-threaded database, which means that only one client can 
access the database at a time.

SQLite is a very popular database because it is small, fast, and easy to use. SQLite is also very reliable, and it has been used in 
production applications for many years.

Here are some of the benefits of using SQLite:

    Small size: SQLite is a very small database, which makes it easy to embed in applications.
    Fast speed: SQLite is a very fast database, which makes it ideal for applications that require high performance.
    Ease of use: SQLite is very easy to use, even for developers who are not familiar with SQL.
    Reliability: SQLite is a very reliable database, and it has been used in production applications for many years.

If you are looking for a small, fast, and easy-to-use database, then SQLite is a good choice.
